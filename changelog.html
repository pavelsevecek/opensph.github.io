			<h2>Update 0.4</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/to2h8zpbfb8oecb53hjtd/SpaceSim_0.4.2.msi?rlkey=6bf2yukhh4pcrotxc9mjzzl1j&dl=1">Download build</a></p>

			<ul>
				<li>New physically based bloom effect with much larger radius and overall more realistic look.</li>
				<li>Improved rendering of black holes when using the raymarcher. Black holes now distort the light emitted by particles and the background, creating gravitational lensing.</li>
				<li>Added shadows to raymarcher. The renderer now calculates shadows casted by individual particles, occluding the directional light.</li>
				<li>Video can now be rendered at any resolution and framerate.</li>
				<li>Cohesion has been added to all shaped objects.</li>
				<li>Planetary rings and accretion disks can now be elliptical and have customizable particle temperatures.</li>
				<li>Added material selection for group objects (free group and orbiting group).</li>
				<li>Added collision prediction to the integrator. When enabled, the time step is automatically adjusted to properly handle collisions of fast-moving objects. </li>
				<li>Added an alternative periodic gravity solver, based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</li>
				<li>Particles can now be stabilized when using the SPH solver, similarly as in OpenSPH.</li>
				<li>Added a visualization of Roche limits to the real-time renderer.</li>
				<li>Added a handheld camera, new type of camera that allows to record and later replay custom camera path.</li>
				<li>Cameras can now be easily selected using the next/previous buttons on the camera page.</li>
				<li>Added a few presets - DART, high speed cratering, igniting stars, Sagittarius A* and spaceship hit by missile.</li>
				<li>Added asteroid (216) Kleopatra.</li>
				<li>Objects can now be saved to a custom object library. Objects added to the library appear at the bottom of the object list.</li>
			</ul>
                            <h2>Update 0.3</h2>
                            <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1cp3mtcjq7n2dot8f6zh2/SpaceSim_0.3.3.msi?rlkey=rtp4lnmcignw0kjrqizr1cjgr&dl=0">Download build</a></p>
                            <span class="image right"><img src="images/changelog/0.3.jpg" /></span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adds an option for asteroids to simulate <b>cohesion</b> between particles, connecting them into chunks that move and rotate as a rigid body.</li>
<li>Chunks and fault planes in asteroids can be visualized using new color modes "Fragment" and "Activation strain", respectively.</li>
<li>Particle noise is now suppressed using artificial viscosity when using the IISPH solver.</li>
<li>Added <b>antialiasing</b> for raytracer.</li>
<li>Added <b>motion blur</b> for raytracer, effect that blurs particles along the velocity vector.</li>
<li>Both antialiasing and motion blur are done by averaging multiple frames, set by 'iteration count' in render settings.</li>
<li>When using the raytracer, the image is now split into square blocks and rendered over several frames, making the UI more responsive and preventing crashes due to GPU timeout.</li>
<li>New simulation option for black holes, creating a <b>jet of particles</b> when it absorbs matter. The jet is perpendicular to the plane in which the particle moved, creating a quasar-like appearance.</li>
<li>The preset 'Accretion disk' was updated to show this effect.</li>
<li>Stars now have variable surface temperature, showing irregular emission patterns and darker regions resembling sunspots. Sunspots can be turned off in the simulation parameters of the star.</li>
<li>Added an option to create a video from the simulation cache stored in history. The app will load every simulation snapshot stored in the history and render an image using current camera and render settings.</li>
<li>Added palette presets, used for color modes and for "cloud-based" objects (molecular clouds and galaxies).</li>
<li>Object 'asteroid field' was replaced by two objects, 'free group' and 'orbiting group'.</li>
<li>Added an ellipsoid and a potatoid (generic customizable shape).</li>
<li>Added a new font with better legibility of numbers.</li>
                            </ul>
                           <h2>Update 0.2.9</h2>
						   <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/neybgxte6biutxosdypo1/SpaceSim_ceed11.msi?rlkey=eo62jk0mmpb9vpfjwk8yxegfe&dl=0">Download build</a></p>
						   <span class="image right"><img src="images/changelog/0.2.9.jpg" /></span>
						   <ul>
						   <li>Non-deformable objects can now absorb particles, enabled by setting 'particle interaction' to 'absorb'.</li>
<li>Absorbed particles transfer their mass to the absorber.</li>
<li>Black holes are now always absorbing particles.</li>
<li>Galaxies and globular clusters now use the global particle count, set in the simulation settings.</li>
<li>Each object has a 'particle budget', used to determine the particle count; for galaxies, each component - disk, halo, and bulge - has a separate budget.</li>
<li>Added 'intensity' to galaxies and clouds, used to adjust the emission of each object.</li>
<li>Created a simulation "Asteroids in Solar System", showing all asteroids in the Minor Planet Center database, along with the Sun and all planets.</li>
<li>Added "Origin of the Moon" simulation preset.</li>
<li>"Cloud-based" objects (molecular clouds and galaxies) are now properly stored in history.</li>
<li>Fixed switching color modes and clip modes while the simulation is paused.</li>
<li>Fixed various crashes, glitches and NaN values.</li>
<li>Also improved the crash reporting, hopefully fixing more crashes in the next update.</li>
						   </ul>
						   <h2>Update 0.2.8</h2>
						   <p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9c0ecr18uh6ei3rgnttw7/SpaceSim_082457.msi?rlkey=btkycicy96rutxjusumjs206j&dl=0">Download build</a></p>
						   <span class="image right"><img src="images/changelog/0.2.8.jpg" /></span>
						   <ul>
						   <li>You can now send feedback or bug report from the app using "About > Send feedback" in the menu.</li>
<li>Added option to share the simulation on Discord, using "File > Share on Discord". The simulation will appear in the channel ‚Å†#beta-simulations .</li>
<li>The app will now attempt to send basic report (simulation info, log file) in case it crashes. You can opt-out of crash reporting under "File > Preferences".</li>
<li>Planets can now have up to four layers - core, mantle, crust and atmosphere.</li>
<li>Added option to specify material for each layer. Currently, there is a fixed list of materials (basalt, olivine, iron, water, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen).</li>
<li>When the color mode is set to "material", each particle is colored by its material and a legend listing the material names is shown.</li>
<li>Clicking on a body during simulation will display a pie chart of its material composition.</li>
<li>Added a new object type - black holes. They are non-deformable spherical objects, having only one physical parameters - their mass.</li>
<li>Added Sagittarius A* and M87 as presets.</li>
<li>Improved the calculation of nuclear fusion, fixing some stars having zero fusion power.</li>
<li>Stars can now display their effective temperature, absolute magnitude and spectral type during the simulation.</li>
<li>Added Proxima Centauri as a preset.</li>
<li>Randomization of molecular clouds is now stable and will always give the same result for given random seed.</li>
<li>Grid used to calculate periodic gravity now has automatic resolution, based on the number of particles. The resolution can be overridden if needed.</li>
<li>Trajectories showing predicted paths of objects during setup are shown for all objects except for rings.</li>
<li>Application icon now shows the current simulation progress.</li>
<li>Added "Core-collapse supernova" simulation preset.</li>
