During the simulation, Earth has to be damaged or destroyed completely.
Video has to be generated by SpaceSim (all versions are allowed). Use either the .avi format or create a video from saved image frames.
Video editing is allowed. You can add music or voiceover, compose multiple videos together, add camera shake, etc. However, adding additional elements (explosions, smoke, ...) is not allowed. 
Simulations containing explicit content or otherwise inappropriate will not be accepted.
## Submission
Upload the finished video to Youtube, Streamable or other video hosting website.
Share the video and your .sim file on Discord in channel #contest-submission.
Consider making the video private before the deadline, to prevent plagiarism by other people.
